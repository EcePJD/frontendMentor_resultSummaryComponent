## My process
The first thing I did is create an asynchronous javascript function that will wait until fetching of the json data is done before continuing the process. The next function I did was a function that combines the dom createElement function and the setAttributes function to create the elements with attributes from the json data. I used a document fragment as a temporary holder of all the appended newly created elements then after the process is done, append the fragment variable to the element with a specific id in the html template. The last thing I did was the style. I just implemented the things I learned about flexbox.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned
Not what I learned but the javascript fetch function and dom function became a refresher since I stopepd programming for almost a year. So all good for me.
